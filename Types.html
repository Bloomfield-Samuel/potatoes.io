        <h3>Russet Potatoes</h3>
        <h4>
            Russet potatoes, also known as Idaho potatoes, are characterized by their rough brown skin and oval shape.<br>
            They have a fluffy texture when cooked, making them ideal for baking, mashing, and frying. Russets are high <br>
            in starch and low in moisture, which contributes to their ability to absorb flavors well. They're commonly <br>
            used in dishes like baked potatoes, french fries, and mashed potatoes due to their versatility and ability <br>
            to hold their shape during cooking.
        </h4>
        <h3>Yukon Gold Potatoes</h3>
        <h4>
            Yukon Gold potatoes are recognized for their smooth, golden-yellow skin and rich, buttery flavor. These <br>
            potatoes have a medium starch content and a creamy texture when cooked, making them excellent for boiling, <br>
            roasting, and mashing. Yukon Golds retain their shape well after cooking, which makes them perfect for <br>
            dishes like potato salads and gratins. Their buttery taste also adds a delightful depth to mashed potatoes <br>
            without needing excessive amounts of butter.
        </h4>
        <h3>Red Potatoes</h3>
        <h4>
            Red potatoes are known for their thin red skin and crisp, white flesh. They have a lower starch content <br>
            and higher moisture content compared to russet potatoes, resulting in a waxy texture that holds its shape <br>
            after cooking. Red potatoes are versatile and well-suited for roasting, boiling, and steaming. Their firm <br>
            texture makes them ideal for dishes like potato salads, soups, and stews. Additionally, their vibrant color <br>
            adds visual appeal to various recipes, making them a popular choice in the kitchen.
